            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Charles Degboe, a senior at the University of Louisville majoring in Computer Information Systems with a double concentration in Business Process Management and Cybersecurity. I’m passionate about using technology to solve problems, improve processes, and create secure, data-driven solutions.</p>
            <p>Through both coursework and my internship, I’ve developed a solid foundation in data analysis, networking, database design, and system security. I’ve worked with real-world data to uncover trends and improve efficiency, while also learning how business operations and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand.</p>
            <p>While I’m still exploring which path I want to focus on long-term, I’m excited about the possibilities in tech — whether it’s improving business processes, securing digital environments, or working with data to drive smarter decisions. I'm eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing wherever I can add the most value.</p>
